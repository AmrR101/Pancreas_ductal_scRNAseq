# What is this?
This is a folder relating to old 3D tSNE mapping. It is no longer utilized in the recent version of our paper, yet remains here for transperency. This folder contains zipped html files which can be downloaded, and opened in any web browser to look at interactive 3D tSNE data of the alk3n3 dataset integrated with a whole pancreas single cell atlas. Additional files also have 3D plots showing gene expression for select genes. Moving a cursor over cells, shows cell number and expression.
