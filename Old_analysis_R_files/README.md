# What is this?

This folder contains R notebook files, and a html file which can be opened in a browser, of older files where the dataset was mapped using tSNE without the optimal negative bionamial normalization employed by the Satija lab. During peer review, this method was deemed incorrect as the samples showed batch specific differences, leading to inaccurate results. This has since been corrected using negative-binomial regression, allowing for sample specific differences to be normalized allowing for a more optimized workflow. Although these files have been left here for record and transparency, please do not implement them without reading recommendations and guidelines outlined by ENCODE and the Satija lab on single cell sequencing data analysis. The html fle has an overview of the analysis and the expected outputs, including how the interactive 3D plots would look like depending on the code run. Download the .zip files, unzip and then open the unzipped file in any html browser (like google chrome). You will see a complete output of the analysis, step by step.
