# Single cell resolution analysis of the human pancreatic ductal progenitor cell niche
## What is this?

This repository contains coding scripts utilized for the analysis performed in the "Single cell resolution analysis of the human pancreatic ductal progenitor cell niche" publication (Qadir/Alvarez-Cubela et. al, 2019). The purpose of providing the code here is to allow for transprency and data-analysis reproducibility. Most of the steps used for data analysis and visualization have been optimised for an average computing environment (for the year 2019). Some analyses however, requires a high-performace computing environment (see computing environment). The methodology has already been described extensively in the manuscript, however this analysis relies heavily on scRNAseq analysis algorithms developed by the Satija lab namely Seurat (for a complete list of dependencies and code utilized see analysis & visualization programs).
